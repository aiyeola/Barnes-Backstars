# Checkpoint Submission Process

Version 2.0

#### Git _Workflow_

This is the recommended Git _workflow_ to enable easy review:

- First create the checkpoint repository on your Github account.
- Clone the repository on your local machine.
- At this point, your will only be having one branch (master), create a new branch (develop) off master branch.
- All your work should done on the **develop** branch.
- On Github, create a Pull Request:
  - Subject: **Checkpoint <number> Review**
  - Description: **write a summary of what youâ€™ve done and your approach.**
- This will make it easy for the reviewer to comment through your code at one glance as opposed to moving in between your commits. See sample below:
